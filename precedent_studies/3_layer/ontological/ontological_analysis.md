The project translates abstract statistical concepts into an operational, perceptible, and reflective diversity measurement experimental platform through five layers of progression: "data object → measurement logic → interaction mechanism → visual presentation → narrative and metadata", and even with the jupyter notebook in Colab.

| Layer                 | Component                                                    | Function                                                     | Relation                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data/Object**       | Sample dataset with abstract shapes (boxes/points, colors, sizes) | Use simplified geometry instead of real pictures to highlight multi-dimensional proportion differences | As input for subsequent metrics and algorithms, responding to user clicks and goal setting |
|                       | Examples of real-life images (doctor, construction worker, etc.) | Shows the complexity of transferring metrics to social attributes (gender, clothing) | Connecting algorithmic results with real-world bias issues   |
| **Metric/Algorithm**  | Aggregation strategy (Mean/Max Difference, Intersectionality) | Combine multi-dimensional differences into an overall "diversity score" to determine the sorting or optimization direction | Different strategies → different subset ranking/selection results |
|                       | “Inclusion” metric                                           | Assesses how well a searcher feels represented, complementing pure distribution metrics | Runs in parallel with diversity metrics to guide system design |
| **Interaction Logic** | Subset picker (click shapes to choose 10)                    | Lets users build candidate sets; recalculates metric differences in real time | Triggers re-computation of all metrics                       |
|                       | Target sliders                                               | Adjust desired proportion for each attribute                 | Shifts metric baselines, affecting optimization goals        |
|                       | Optimize / Auto-recommend button                             | System selects the “best” subset using mean or max strategy  | Calls the metric layer to produce candidates                 |
| **Visualization**     | Main grid displaying the current subset                      | Gives an immediate visual breakdown of elements              | Two-way binding with the interaction layer                   |
|                       | Twenty side-by-side bar pairs                                | Ranks and contrasts *mean* vs *max* selections               | Highlights the effect of aggregation strategy                |
|                       | Mini histograms                                              | Tiny charts of the three attribute proportions               | Enables fine-grained quantitative reading                    |
|                       | Narrative text & links                                       | Explains concepts, cites the paper Diversity & Inclusion Metrics in Subset Selection, offers a Colab demo | Supplies background reading and further experimentation      |
