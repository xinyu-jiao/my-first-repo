| Section                                         | Key Elements                                                 | Description & Function                                       | Communicative Effect                                         |

| **3.1 Visual Assets**                           | **Abstract-shape grid** – coloured squares/circles in three attribute dimensions (colour, shape dot, size). The chosen subset of 10 is highlighted with a magenta outline | Reduces multidimensional data to minimalist visual units that users can compare instantly | Immediate feedback supports the “trial–adjust–measure” learning loop |
|                                                 | **Target sliders & magenta values** – black tick marks show desired proportions; actual value and difference appear in magenta text that matches the selection outline | Couples the numerical concept of *difference* to a single attention-grabbing hue | Numeric and visual channels reinforce each other, lowering cognitive load |
|                                                 | **Side-by-side bar-and-slope chart** – twenty candidate subsets ranked in two columns (*Mean Difference* vs *Max Difference*), each bar embedding three-colour mini histograms | Lets readers see at a glance how the two metrics reorder the same data | Makes the abstract choice of metric tangible and debate-ready |
|                                                 | **Real-image galleries** – doctor and construction-worker examples, ten photos each, contrasting gender or attire diversity | Bridges the abstract-shape demo to socially salient categories | Links metric discussion to real-world bias, evoking empathy  |
| **3.2 Visual Language**                         | **Colour system** – blue, green and orange encode three attributes; magenta is reserved exclusively for “difference/alert” | Ensures colour-blind accessibility and establishes a one-to-one map between colour and concept | Colour itself becomes part of the explanatory grammar        |
|                                                 | **Contrast & spacing** – generous white space around elements and clear section headers | Keeps the focus on the interactive artefacts rather than decorative clutter | Supports a “read ⇄ play” rhythm without visual fatigue       |
| **3.3 Visual Rhetoric**                         | **Gradient narrative** – sequence moves from (1) pure geometry → (2) multi-metric ranking → (3) real photos → (4) explanatory text | Gradual complexity allows novices and experts alike to follow | Visual structure itself tells the story, reducing reliance on prose |
|                                                 | **Comparative framing** – repeated “A vs B” juxtapositions: *mean vs max*, male-presenting vs female-presenting doctors, realistic vs cartoon workers | Side-by-side layouts make differences self-evident           | Encourages users to reach the normative insight that *metric choice = value choice* |
|                                                 | **Magenta “difference” numbers**                             | Numbers double as visual hotspots                            | Turns quantitative deviation into an emotional cue for action |
| **3.4 Stylistic Lineage & Community Placement** | **Explorable Explanation lineage** – follows the Bret Victor / Nicky Case tradition of “learning through interaction,” while adopting Google PAIR’s clean Material-lite aesthetic | Positions the work within the data-vis and HCI education community | Signals credibility and lowers the barrier for reuse in classrooms or product teams |
|                                                 | **Equity-minded design cues** – colour palette, white-space discipline and contrast echo outlets like *Data Feminism* and *The Pudding*. | Embeds the technical topic in a social-justice visual vernacular. | Aligns the project with broader conversations about fairness and inclusion |

1. **Color carries meaning** – the strict mapping of blue/green/orange to attributes and magenta to error makes the palette itself an instructional instrument.
2. **Progressive disclosure** – moving from abstract shapes to real-world photos lowers emotional resistance and raises stakes simultaneously.
3. **Contrast-driven persuasion** – nearly every section employs visual comparison, inviting users to *see* rather than *read* the argument.
4. **Community signaling** – shared design patterns with other “explorable” projects and equity-oriented media place the work in an activist-educational ecosystem.
